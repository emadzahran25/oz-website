OZ Co-Working Park â€” React preview
=================================

What's included:
- Vite + React project (src/App.jsx uses your uploaded Blackbox output where possible)
- Images copied to public/images: LOBBY_01.jpg, LOBBY_04.jpg, LOBBY_05.jpg, CAFE_FINAL_01.jpg, CAFE_FINAL_03.jpg, AUDITORIUM_FINAL_03.jpg, AUDITORIUM_FINAL_05.jpg, CO-FITNESS_02.jpg, CO-FITNESS_03.jpg, CO-FITNESS_04.jpg

Quick steps to run locally:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port Vite shows)

To deploy to Vercel:
- Push this project to GitHub and import the repo in Vercel (it will detect Vite/React and deploy)
- Or drag & drop the 'dist' folder (after `npm run build`) into Netlify.

If you'd like, I can also produce a ready-to-deploy GitHub repo (zip contains everything).



import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: { port: 3000 }
})
